## sraFind
I was curious how many complete genomes had publicly available data associated on the SRA. We do this in 4 stages:

2. Run all those entrez commands in parallel

3. Parse results

4. Plot results

## Poker Simulations
Have you ever wanted to run lots of Texas Hold'em simulations? [I have](./texas_holdem/cards.R), so I wrote this.  One day it might be a shiny app.
