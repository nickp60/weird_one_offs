This repo is for mini-analyses.

## sraFind
I was curious how many complete genomes had publicly available data associated on the SRA.

[This script gets a list of all accessions for complete prokaryotic genomes](sraFind/scrips/get_acces.py)

[This script gets the associated BioProject accession, and (if available) SRA accession](sraFind/scrips/fetcher.py)

[This script plots the results](sraFind/scrips/plot_results.R)

[This is a plot of the results](sraFind/results/2017-10-16-results-byyear.png)
